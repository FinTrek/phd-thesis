\begin{abstract}
  % The abstract should outline the main approach and findings of the thesis and
  % must be between 300 and 800 words.

A typical problem in the field of rare-event estimation is to find the probability $\Prob(S > \gamma)$ where $S := X_1 + \dots + X_d$ for a fixed $d \in \NL$ and where the $\gamma \in \RL$ is large or increasing. In applications we often wish to understand the behaviour of a combination of random factors. Hence the random variable $S$ is ubiquitous in real-world modeling problems.
It can model, for example, aggregate risk or portfolio value for holding $d$ risky assets \cite{mcneil2015quantitative,Rueschendorf2013}, the aggregate losses for $d$ insurance policy claims \cite{asmussen2010ruin,klugman2012loss}, and the combined signal interference from $d$ wireless transmission sources \cite{fischione2007approximation}.
Probabilities of this form are used to understand how a system would behave under extreme scenarios such as a market crash, a power surge, or a natural disaster. One is typically interested in, not just the quantity $\Prob(S > \gamma)$, but the behaviour of the summands when the extreme event $\{ S > \gamma \}$ occurs.

This probability is available in a closed form for only a few basic cases, when the density of $S$ (which is a $d$-fold convolution) has a known form; see~\cite{nadarajah2008review}.
For example, when the summands are independent and identically distributed (iid), then it is sometimes simple to calculate (for exponential, gamma, normal, binomial, geometric, or negative binomial summands)
and sometimes intractable (for lognormal, Weibull, Laplace, or Beta).
However, requiring the assumption of independence (let alone iid-ness) of the summands is a stifling restriction when modeling real-world events; a notorious example would be the partial blame of the 2008--09 global financial crisis on mathematicians' inappropriate use of a simplistic dependence model (the Gaussian copula)~\cite{salmon2009recipe}.

This thesis outlines methods for approximating quantities related to sums of random variables. Two chapters consider the use of \emph{orthogonal polynomial expansions} in approximating probability density functions; one focuses on sums of correlated lognormal random variables, and the other on random sums which are used in insurance.
We also introduce
%a Monte Carlo estimator for the density of a sum distribution which uses the \emph{push-out method}, and
an \emph{importance sampling estimator} for the survival function of a sum distribution which uses knowledge of the asymptotic form of the sum.
We also give the results of an \emph{asymptotic analysis}
%of the survival function of sums with Weibull-like summands, and
of the Laplace transform for the sum of lognormal random variables.
A related problem, of estimating the probability of the maximum of a random vector exceeding a large threshold, is also considered.

{\large \bfseries Beregningsmetoder for summer af stokastiske variable}

\medskip
{\em Abstrakt\/}.
\end{center}

Et typisk problem i forbindelse med estimation af sj{\ae}ldne h{\ae}ndelser er at finde sandsynligheden $\Prob (S> \gamma)$ hvor $S: = X_1 + \dots + X_d$ for et fast $d \in \NL$, og hvor $\gamma \in \RL$ er stor eller voksende. I anvendelser er man ofte interesseret i at forst\aa\ opf{\o}rslen af en kombination af stokastiske faktorer. Derfor er den stokastiske variabel $S$ naturligt forekommende i praktiske modelleringsproblemer.
Den kan f.eks. bruges som til modellering af en samlet risiko, af en portef{\o}ljev{\ae}rdi ved en beholdning af $d$ risikofyldte aktiver \cite {mcneil2015quantitative, Rueschendorf2013}, af det samlede tab for $d$ forsikringsforpligtelser \cite {asmussen2010ruin, klugman2012loss} og af den kombinerede signalinterferens fra $d$ trÃ¥dl{\o}se transmissionskilder \cite {fischione2007approximation}.
Sandsynligheder af denne form bruges til at forst\aa , hvordan et system vil opf{\o}re sig under ekstreme forhold som f.eks. et b\o rskrak, et str\o msvigt eller en naturkatastrofe. Typisk er man ikke kun interesseret i st\o rrelsen $\Prob (S> \gamma) $, men ogs\aa\ i opf{\o}rslen af summanderne n\aa r den ekstreme h\ae ndelse $\{S> \gamma \}$ indtr\ae ffer.

Kun i ganske f\aa\ tilf\ae lde er denne sandsynlighed tilg\ae ngelig i lukket form, n\aa r t{\ae}theden af $S$ (som svarer til $d$ foldinger) har en kendt form; se~\cite {nadarajah2008review}.
For eksempel n\aa r summanderne er uafh{\ae}ngige og identisk fordelte (iid), er t\ae theden nogle gange nem at beregne (hvis summandernes fordeling er eksponentiel, gamma, normal, binomial, geometrisk eller negativ binomial), og andre gange er det ikke muligt (hvis summandernes fordeling er lognormal, Weibull, Laplace eller Beta).
Dog er antagelsen om uafh{\ae}ngighed (og i s\ae rdeleshed om iid) mellem summanderne en seri\o s begr{\ae}nsning ved modellering af virkelige h{\ae}ndelser; et notorisk eksempel er den delvise skyld i den globale finanskrise i 2008--2009, som matematikerne b{\ae}rer, grundet upassende brug af en simpel afh{\ae}ngighedsmodel (den gaussiske copula)~\cite {salmon2009recipe}.

Denne afhandling beskriver metoder til approksimation af st\o rrelser relateret til summer af stokastiske variable. To kapitler omhandler anvendelsen af \emph {ortogonale polynomielle udviklinger} til approksimation af t\ae thedsfunktioner; det ene fokuserer p\aa\ summer af korrelerede lognormale stokastiske variable og det andet p\aa\ stokastiske summer, der anvendes i forsikring.
Vi introducerer ogs\aa\ en \emph{importance sampling-estimator} for overlevelsesfunktionen af en sumfordeling, som bygger p\aa\ viden om den asymptotiske form af summen.
Endvidere giver vi resultaterne af en \emph {asymptotisk analyse}
af Laplace-transformen af summen af lognormale stokastiske variable. Endeligt behandler vi et relateret problem, som vedr\o rer estimation af sandsynligheden for, at maksimum af en stokastisk vektor overskrider et givet stort niveau.

I have been incredibly lucky to have been supported by many institutions, academics, mentors, friends, and family members, without whom this thesis would not exist. %Here, I am delighted to be able to record my thanks to some of these people.

Firstly, I must sincerely thank my supervisors in Aarhus and Brisbane, S{\o}ren Asmussen and Phil Pollett. S{\o}ren welcomed me into Denmark, gave me a path in applied probability, and calmly guided me along the way. It is due to his meetings, emails, lectures, and books that I have learned so much these past years, and met so many friendly mathematicians all across Europe. Having joined the hiking trip in Greenland which he organised, and seen his pre-departure presentation, inspires me to go and make the most of each day.%\footnote{In this presentation he described many previous hiking adventures, including one in which a companion did not return. While this certainly heightened the \emph{carpe diem} sensation, it was decidedly unhelpful for allaying last-minute jitters!}

Phil Pollett is the reason why I became passionate about probability in the first place. It was only by chance that I enrolled in his probability course STAT3004 in 2012. His well prepared and entertaining lectures (replete with a \emph{schadenfreude}-inducing tyranny aimed at the unpunctual students) inspired me to pursue mathematics research instead of a standard engineering career. As my honours supervisor Phil was unfailingly positive and helpful, always emphasising that the enjoyment of the journey was of paramount importance. He gave me the confidence to begin my PhD. I can say, with probability one, that two better supervisors than S{\o}ren and Phil cannot be found!

Thomas Taimre has taught me an incredible amount during his lectures and chats in his office or over Merlo coffee. He dissected draft after draft of my honours thesis, explaining to me a menagerie of minuscule typography, \TeX, and grammar rules. I'm very grateful for the help of Leonardo Rojas-Nandayapa, who recommended me to S{\o}ren, undertook a vast amount of negotiation and paperwork to setup this joint PhD, and supervised the first half of my PhD.

I must sincerely thank my collaborators: Jens Ledet Jensen, Pierre-Olivier Goffard, Lars N{\o}rvang Andersen, Enkelejd Hashorva, Robert Salomone, Zdravko I.\ Botev, Jevgenijs Ivanovs, and Hailiang Yang. I hope to work with you again soon!

Being part of the research group ACEMS has been a wonderful experience. They supported me in a variety of ways, including a stipend, conference travel funding, and attendance at the yearly retreat. In particular, Peter Taylor has been a great mentor for me, and I'm thankful that he hosted me in Melbourne in 2017.

I benefited from many great teachers over the years. Joel Fenwick's memorable and meticulous course on programming taught me so much that I felt like a totally different person after completing it. And before this, I am grateful for my Mackay teachers Janelle Agius, Brendan Gunning, Pauline Hendry, and Glen Smith.

The Australian and Danish governments have been essential in their financial support of my research. I am very thankful to the graduate schools in both universities for allowing this joint degree.

My time in these maths departments has been enriched by the friends I've made there. In Australia, this included Alice, Azam, Leslie, Liam, Marielle, and Rob, and in Denmark, Claudio, Julie, Mikkel, Pierre-Olivier, Thorbj{\o}rn, Victor, and It{\^o}.\footnote{Note, I am not referring to the esteemed mathematician Kiyoshi It{\^o} --- whose work has brought me many a headache --- but to Victor \& Line's cute dog, who would visit the office and is named after him.} I can't thank you enough for the coffee and \emph{kage} (and the occasional \emph{{\o}l}) breaks which were needed to preserve one's sanity. Also, it was an unlikely pleasure to meet housemates in Nordre Ringgade and Hoogley Street who are such great people.

I'm blessed to have met my partner Vivian, who has been such a tremendous source of joy and energy and peace. We are certainly taking the road less traveled by --- let it keep going, as winding as unpredictable as ever! My closest friends, Autumn, Blake, Bryce, Evan, Nina, Tiffany, Tzara, and Will, have helped me in infinitely many ways over the years. Thank-you. Also, I thank my capitalist friends Elliot and Rory for their company.

Finally, and most importantly, I have to thank my family. To Mum and Dad, I'm thankful for everything. From day one (and as Mum would hasten to add, from much earlier than that!) you have worked hard to support every one of my endeavours. You taught me patience, humility, and the value of education. Thanks Chris, Flick, Nanna, and Sam for your long-distance company, care, advice, and Skype calls.

If we relax $\alpha \in \NL$ to $\alpha > 0$ this is the \emph{negative binomial distribution}.
