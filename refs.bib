  abstract = {Incomplete lineage sorting can cause incongruencies of the overall species-level phylogenetic tree with the phylogenetic trees for individual genes or genomic segments. If these incongruencies are not accounted for, it is possible to incur several biases in species tree estimation. Here, we present a simple maximum likelihood approach that accounts for ancestral variation and incomplete lineage sorting. We use a POlymorphisms-aware phylogenetic MOdel (PoMo) that we have recently shown to efficiently estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from within and between-species variation data. We extend this model to perform efficient estimation of species trees. We test the performance of PoMo in several different scenarios of incomplete lineage sorting using simulations and compare it with existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed. In contrast to other approaches, our model does not use coalescent theory but is allele frequency based. We show that PoMo is well suited for genome-wide species tree estimation and that on such data it is more accurate than previous approaches.},

The probabilities (and factorial moments) can be conveniently expressed in terms of modified Hermite polynomials (hence the proposed name). Writing these in confluent hypergeometric form leads to two quite different representations of any particular probability-one a finite series, the other an infinite series.The cumulants and moments are given. Necessary conditions on the parameters and their maximum-likelihood estimation are discussed.It is shown, with examples, that the Hermite distribution is a special case of the Poisson Binomial distribution (n = 2) and may be regarded as either the distribution of the sum of two correlated Poisson variables or the distribution of the sum of an ordinary Poisson variable and an (independent) Poisson 'doublet' variable (i.e. the occurrence of pairs of events is distributed as a Poisson).Lastly its use as a penultimate limiting form of distributions with P.G.F. is examined.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

One of the important factors that cause this difference is genetic polymorphism in the ancestral species. Under the assumption of neutral mutations, this problem can be studied by evaluating the probability (P) that a gene tree has the same topology as that of the species tree. When one gene (allele) is used from each of the species involved, the probability can be expressed as a simple function of Ti = ti/(2N), where ti is the evolutionary time measured in generations for the ith internodal branch of the species tree and N is the effective population size. When any of the Ti's is less than 1, the probability P becomes considerably less than 1.0. This probability cannot be substantially increased by increasing the number of alleles sampled from a locus. To increase the probability, one has to use DNA sequences from many different loci that have evolved independently of each other.},

The distribution of ?2 LF, characterized in this study with Monte Carlo simulations, depends on the parameter ? (=4Nu). The values of ? required to explain the observed value of ?2 LF are determined and found to be incompatible with the low levels of heterozygosity observed at the hemoglobin loci in humans. It is concluded that the constant-rate neutral model is highly improbable. Other neutral models and models involving natural selection need to be considered.},

  abstract  = {The principal part of this paper is devoted to the study of the distribution and density functions of the ratio of two normal random variables. It gives several representations of the distribution function in terms of the variate normal distribution of Nicholson's V function, both of which have been extensively studied, and for which tables and computational procedures are readily available. One of these representations leads to an easy derivation of the density function in terms of the Cauchy density and the normal density and integral. A number of graphs of the possible shapes of the density are given, together with an indication of when the density is unimodal or bimodal. The last part of the paper discusses the distribution of the ratio (u<sub>1</sub> + ? + u<sub>n</sub>)/(v<sub>1</sub> + ? + v<sub>m</sub>) where the u's and v's are independent, uniform variables. The exact distribution for all n and m is given, and some approximations discussed.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed nucleotide sequence variation in an approximately 900-base pair region of the human mitochondrial DNA molecule encompassing the heavy strand origin of replication and the D-loop. Our analysis has focused on nucleotide sequences available from seven humans. Average nucleotide diversity among the sequences is 1.7%, several-fold higher than estimates from restriction endonuclease site variation in mtDNA from these individuals and previously reported for other humans. This disparity is consistent with the rapidly evolving nature of this noncoding region. However, several instances of convergent or parallel gain and loss of restriction sites due to multiple substitutions were observed. In addition, other results suggest that restriction site (as well as pairwise sequence) comparisons may underestimate the total number of substitutions that have occurred since the divergence of two mtDNA sequences from a common ancestral sequence, even at low levels of divergence. This emphasizes the importance of recognizing the large standard errors associated with estimates of sequence variability, particularly when constructing phylogenies among closely related sequences. Analysis of the observed number and direction of substitutions revealed several significant biases, most notably a strand dependence of substitution type and a 32-fold bias favoring transitions over transversions. The results also revealed a significantly nonrandom distribution of nucleotide substitutions and sequence length variation. Significantly more multiple substitutions were observed than expected for these closely related sequences under the assumption of uniform rates of substitution. The bias for transitions has resulted in predominantly convergent or parallel changes among the observed multiple substitutions. There is no convincing evidence that recombination has contributed to the mtDNA sequence diversity we have observed.},

To know if selection has been operating in the recent past and to understand the details of its dynamics, we obtained DNA sequences of Acp26Aa and the nearby Acp26Ab gene from 39 D. melanogaster chromosomes. Together with the 10 published sequences, we analyzed 49 sequences from five populations in four continents. The southern African population is somewhat differentiated from all other populations, but its nucleotide diversity is lower at these two loci. We find the following results for Acp26Aa: (1) The R: S (replacement : silent changes) ratio is significantly higher in the between-species comparisons than in the within-species data by the McDonald and Kreitman test. Positive selection is probably responsible for the excess of amino acid replacements between species. (2) However, within-species nucleotide diversity is high. Neither the Tajima test nor the Fu and Li test indicates a reduction in nucleotide diversity due to positive selection in the recent past. (3) The newly derived nucleotides in D. melanogaster are at high frequency significantly more often than predicted by the neutral equilibrium. Since the nearby Acp26Ab gene does not show these patterns, these observations cannot be attributed to the characteristics of this chromosomal region. We suggest that positive selection is active, but may be weak, for each amino acid change in the Acp26Aa gene.},

The method is adaptive: as sampling proceeds, the rejection envelope and the squeezing function converge to the density function. The rejection envelope and squeezing function are piece-wise exponential functions, the rejection envelope touching the density at previously sampled points, and the squeezing function forming arcs between those points of contact. The technique is intended for situations where evaluation of the density is computationally expensive, in particular for applications of Gibbs sampling to Bayesian models with non-conjugacy. We apply the technique to a Gibbs sampling analysis of monoclonal antibody reactivity.},

They can be defined for any random variable whose mean exists and form the basis of a general theory which covers the summarization and description of theoretical probability distributions, the summarization and description of observed data samples, estimation of parameters and quantiles of probability distributions, and hypothesis tests for probability distributions. The theory involves such established procedures as the use of order statistics and Gini's mean difference statistic, and gives rise to some promising innovations such as the measures of skewness and kurtosis described in Section 2, and new methods of parameter estimation for several distributions. The theory of L-moments parallels the theory of (conventional) moments, as this list of applications might suggest. The main advantage of L-moments over conventional moments is that L-moments, being linear functions of the data, suffer less from the effects of sampling variability: L-moments are more robust than conventional moments to outliers in the data and enable more secure inferences to be made from small samples about an underlying probability distribution. L-moments sometimes yield more efficient parameter estimates than the maximum likelihood estimates.},

Therefore it is of major interest to approximate the coalescent with recombination process by a Markov chain along sequences. We consider the finite loci case and two or more sequences. We formulate a natural Markovian approximation for the tree building process along the sequences, and derive simple and analytically tractable formulae for the distribution of the tree at the next locus conditioned on the tree at the present locus. We compare our Markov approximation to other sequential Markov chains and discuss various applications. },

In this paper, I analyze a model in which speciation occurs by random bifurcation of existing lineages. A method of calculating the probability of an evolutionary tree by counting the possible arrangements of its nodes, branches, and terminal taxa is presented. Probabilities that sets of species are distinct clades are also given. The results are applicable to any number of taxa. Probabilities of trees are not altered by the absence of extinct or unstudied taxa. Applications of the results to systematics and further problems in the probability of evolutionary trees are discussed.},

The search uses our recently developed coalescent hidden Markov model (HMM) framework. We find ILS present in ~1% of the genome, and that the ancestral species of human and chimpanzees never experienced a severe population bottleneck. The existence of ILS is validated with simulations, site pattern analysis, and analysis of rare genomic events. The existence of ILS allows us to disentangle the time of isolation of humans and orangutans (the speciation time) from the genetic divergence time, and we find speciation to be as recent as 9–13 million years ago (Mya; contingent on the calibration point). The analyses provide further support for a recent speciation of human and chimpanzee at ~4 Mya and a diverse ancestor of human and chimpanzee with an effective population size of about 50,000 individuals. Posterior decoding infers ILS for each nucleotide in the genome, and we use this to deduce patterns of selection in the ancestral species. We demonstrate the effect of background selection in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. In agreement with predictions from population genetics, ILS was found to be reduced in exons and gene-dense regions when we control for confounding factors such as GC content and recombination rate. Finally, we find the broad-scale recombination rate to be conserved through the complete ape phylogeny.},

<p>We present a hidden Markov model that uses variation in coalescence times between two distantly related populations, or closely related species, to infer population genetics parameters in ancestral population or species. The model infers the divergence times in segments along the alignment. Using coalescent simulations, we show that the model accurately estimates the divergence time between the two populations and the effective population size of the ancestral population. We apply the model to the recently sequenced orangutan sub-species and estimate their divergence time and the effective population size of their ancestor population.</p>

A key parameter is the time “when we became human,” i.e., the time in the past when descendents of the human–chimp ancestor split into human and chimpanzee. Other important parameters are the time in the past when descendents of the human–chimp–gorilla ancestor split into descendents of the human–chimp ancestor and the gorilla ancestor, and population sizes of the human–chimp and human–chimp–gorilla ancestors. To estimate speciation times and ancestral population sizes we have developed a new methodology that explicitly utilizes the spatial information in contiguous genome alignments. Furthermore, we have applied this methodology to four long autosomal human–chimp–gorilla–orangutan alignments and estimated a very recent speciation time of human and chimp (around 4 million years) and ancestral population sizes much larger than the present-day human effective population size. We also analyzed X-chromosome sequence data and found that the X chromosome has experienced a different history from that of autosomes, possibly because of selection.</p></sec>},

  abstract  = {<p>Previously, we observed that without using prior information about individual sampling locations, a clustering algorithm applied to multilocus genotypes from worldwide human populations produced genetic clusters largely coincident with major geographic regions. It has been argued, however, that the degree of clustering is diminished by use of samples with greater uniformity in geographic distribution, and that the clusters we identified were a consequence of uneven sampling along genetic clines. Expanding our earlier dataset from 377 to 993 markers, we systematically examine the influence of several study design variables—sample size, number of loci, number of clusters, assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across populations, and the geographic dispersion of the sample—on the “clusteredness” of individuals. With all other variables held constant, geographic dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree of clustering. Examination of the relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.</p>},

  abstract = {There is widespread interest in characterizing the organization of human genetic variation around the world from a population perspective. Related to this are attempts to describe the pattern of genetic variation in the human species generally, including “recreational” genomics, the genome-based estimation of the ancestry of individuals. These approaches rest on subtle concepts of variation, time, and ancestry that are perhaps not widely appreciated. They share the idea that there are, or were, discrete panmictic human populations such that every person is either a member of such a population or is an admixed descendant of them. Ancestry fraction estimation is biased by assumptions about past and present human population structure, as when we trace ancestry to hypothetical unmixed ancestral populations, or assign an individual's ancestry to continental populations that are indistinguishable from classical “races.” Attempts to identify even individuals' local subpopulations are less precise than most (geneticists included) expect, because that is usually based on a small portion of a person's ancestry, relative to the much larger pool of comparably related ancestors. It is easier to show that two people have some relationship than to show who or where the actual ancestor was. There is an important distinction between individuals' demographic ancestry and the ancestry of their genes. Despite superficial appearances, these interpretations of genetic data are often based on typological rather than Darwinian thinking, raising important issues about the questions that are actually being asked.},

  abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci—e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

The concepts of gene identity and genetically distinct states and the derivation of joint and conditional phenotype distributions have been extensively studied for the case of two individuals, by, amongst many others, Cotterman [1940], Malecot [1948], Li and Sacks [1954], and Jacquard [1972]. In this paper it is shown how these ideas may be extended to relationships between any number of individuals. Problems regarding the specification of genetically distinct gene identity states are resolved by considering the group structure of the set of all identity states. A genealogical relationship between any number of individuals is regarded as a probability distribution over the space of genetically distinct states, and hence expressions for the joint genotype distributions of several relatives may be found.},

This characterization explains the robustness of the Ewens formula when neither selection nor recurrent mutation is significant, although different structures arise from selective and 'charge-state' models.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The amount of genome-wide molecular data is increasing rapidly, as is interest in developing methods appropriate for such data. There is a consequent increasing need for methods that are able to efficiently simulate such data. In this paper we implement the sequentially Markovian coalescent algorithm described by McVean and Cardin and present a further modification to that algorithm which slightly improves the closeness of the approximation to the full coalescent model. The algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree. RESULTS We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions, such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data, in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing coalescent algorithms. CONCLUSION This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent models. },

We discuss why the coalescent with recombination is so challenging to work with and explore whether simpler models, under which inference is more tractable, may prove useful for genealogy-based inference. We introduce a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation and as the basis for statistical inference.}},

  abstract = {Analysis of genomic data requires an efficient way to calculate likelihoods across very large numbers of loci. We describe a general method for finding the distribution of genealogies: we allow migration between demes, splitting of demes [as in the isolation-with-migration (IM) model], and recombination between linked loci. These processes are described by a set of linear recursions for the generating function of branch lengths. Under the infinite-sites model, the probability of any configuration of mutations can be found by differentiating this generating function. Such calculations are feasible for small numbers of sampled genomes: as an example, we show how the generating function can be derived explicitly for three genes under the two-deme IM model. This derivation is done automatically, using Mathematica. Given data from a large number of unlinked and nonrecombining blocks of sequence, these results can be used to find maximum-likelihood estimates of model parameters by tabulating the probabilities of all relevant mutational configurations and then multiplying across loci. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by applying it to simulated data and to a data set previously analyzed by Wang and Hey (2010) consisting of 26,141 loci sampled from Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster. Our results suggest that such likelihood calculations are scalable to genomic data as long as the numbers of sampled individuals and mutations per sequence block are small.},

  year     = {2012},
  abstract = {We implement an isolation with migration model for three species, with migration occurring between two closely related species while an outgroup species is used to provide further information concerning gene trees and model parameters. The model is implemented in the likelihood framework for analyzing multi-locus genomic sequence alignments, with one sequence sampled from each of the three species. The prior distribution of gene tree topology and branch lengths at every locus is calculated using a Markov chain characterization of the genealogical process of coalescent and migration, which integrates over the histories of migration events analytically. The likelihood function is calculated by integrating over branch lengths in the gene trees (coalescent times) numerically. We analyze the model to study the gene tree-species tree mismatch probability and the time to the most recent common ancestor at a locus. The model is used to construct a likelihood ratio test of speciation with gene flow. We conduct computer simulations to evaluate the likelihood ratio test, and found that the test is in general conservative, with the false positive rate well below the significance level. For the test to have substantial power, hundreds of loci are needed. Application of the test to a human-chimpanzee-gorilla genomic dataset suggests gene flow around the time of speciation of the human and the chimpanzee.},

  abstract = {The sequentially Markov coalescent is a simplified genealogical process that aims to capture the essential features of the full coalescent model with recombination, while being scalable in the number of loci. In this article, the sequentially Markov framework is applied to the conditional sampling distribution (CSD), which is at the core of many statistical tools for population genetic analyses. Briefly, the CSD describes the probability that an additionally sampled DNA sequence is of a certain type, given that a collection of sequences has already been observed. A hidden Markov model (HMM) formulation of the sequentially Markov CSD is developed here, yielding an algorithm with time complexity linear in both the number of loci and the number of haplotypes. This work provides a highly accurate, practical approximation to a recently introduced CSD derived from the diffusion process associated with the coalescent with recombination. It is empirically demonstrated that the improvement in accuracy of the new CSD over previously proposed HMM-based CSDs increases substantially with the number of loci. The framework presented here can be adopted in a wide range of applications in population genetics, including imputing missing sequence data, estimating recombination rates, and inferring human colonization history.},

For population genetic inference we have sequenced many loci, but only in a few individuals. We present a new method that allows inference of the divergence process based on two closely related genomes, modelled as gradual isolation in an isolation with migration model. This allows estimation of the initial time of restricted gene flow, the cessation of gene flow, as well as the population sizes, migration rates, and recombination rates. We show by simulations that the parameter estimation is accurate with genome-wide data and use the model to disentangle the divergence processes among three sets of closely related great ape species: bonobo/chimpanzee, eastern/western gorillas, and Sumatran/Bornean orang-utans. We find allopatric speciation for bonobo and chimpanzee and non-allopatric speciation for the gorillas and orang-utans. We also consider the split between humans and chimpanzees/bonobos and find evidence for non-allopatric speciation, similar to that within gorillas and orang-utans.</p>},

  abstract  = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>The demographic forces that have shaped the pattern of genetic variability in the plant species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> provide an important backdrop for the use of this model organism in understanding the genetic determinants of plant natural variation. We investigated the demographic history of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> using novel population-genetic tools applied to a combination of molecular and geographic data. We infer that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> entered Europe from the east and spread westward at a rate of ~0.9 kilometers per year, and that its population size began increasing around 10,000 years ago. The “wave-of-advance” model suggested by these results is potentially consistent with the pattern expected if the species colonized Europe as the ice retreated at the end of the most recent glaciation. Alternatively, it is also compatible with the possibility that <italic>A. thaliana</italic>—a weedy species—may have spread into Europe with the diffusion of agriculture, providing an example of the phenomenon of “ecological imperialism” described by A. Crosby. In this framework, just as weeds from Europe invaded temperate regions worldwide during European human colonization, weeds originating from the source region of farming invaded Europe as a result of the disturbance caused by the spread of agriculture.</p>},

  abstract = {Studies of worldwide human variation have discovered three trends in summary statistics as a function of increasing geographic distance from East Africa: a decrease in heterozygosity, an increase in linkage disequilibrium (LD), and a decrease in the slope of the ancestral allele frequency spectrum. Forward simulations of unlinked loci have shown that the decline in heterozygosity can be described by a serial founder model, in which populations migrate outward from Africa through a process where each of a series of populations is formed from a subset of the previous population in the outward expansion. Here, we extend this approach by developing a retrospective coalescent-based serial founder model that incorporates linked loci. Our model both recovers the observed decline in heterozygosity with increasing distance from Africa and produces the patterns observed in LD and the ancestral allele frequency spectrum. Surprisingly, although migration between neighboring populations and limited admixture between modern and archaic humans can be accommodated in the model while continuing to explain the three trends, a competing model in which a wave of outward modern human migration expands into a series of preexisting archaic populations produces nearly opposite patterns to those observed in the data. We conclude by developing a simpler model to illustrate that the feature that permits the serial founder model but not the archaic persistence model to explain the three trends observed with increasing distance from Africa is its incorporation of a cumulative effect of genetic drift as humans colonized the world.},

  abstract = {Most methods for studying divergence with gene flow rely upon data from many individuals at few loci. Such data can be useful for inferring recent population history but they are unlikely to contain sufficient information about older events. However, the growing availability of genome sequences suggests a different kind of sampling scheme, one that may be more suited to studying relatively ancient divergence. Data sets extracted from whole-genome alignments may represent very few individuals but contain a very large number of loci. To take advantage of such data we developed a new maximum-likelihood method for genomic data under the isolation-with-migration model. Unlike many coalescent-based likelihood methods, our method does not rely on Monte Carlo sampling of genealogies, but rather provides a precise calculation of the likelihood by numerical integration over all genealogies. We demonstrate that the method works well on simulated data sets. We also consider two models for accommodating mutation rate variation among loci and find that the model that treats mutation rates as random variables leads to better estimates. We applied the method to the divergence of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans and detected a low, but statistically significant, signal of gene flow from D. simulans to D. melanogaster.},

  abstract = {The genetic study of diverging, closely related populations is required for basic questions on demography and speciation, as well as for biodiversity and conservation research. However, it is often unclear whether divergence is due simply to separation or whether populations have also experienced gene flow. These questions can be addressed with a full model of population separation with gene flow, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters. We have generalized this method and made it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci. These loci can vary in their modes of inheritance, and inheritance scalars can be implemented either as constants or as parameters to be estimated. By treating inheritance scalars as parameters it is also possible to address variation among loci in the impact via linkage of recurrent selective sweeps or background selection. These methods are applied to a large multilocus data set from Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The species are estimated to have diverged ~500,000 years ago. Several loci have nonzero estimates of gene flow since the initial separation of the species, with considerable variation in gene flow estimates among loci, in both directions between the species.},

Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often correspond to individual populations.

  abstract = {Motivation: A promising class of methods for large-scale population genomic inference use the conditional sampling distribution (CSD), which approximates the probability of sampling an individual with a particular DNA sequence, given that a collection of sequences from the population has already been observed. The CSD has a wide range of applications, including imputing missing sequence data, estimating recombination rates, inferring human colonization history and identifying tracts of distinct ancestry in admixed populations. Most well-used CSDs are based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Although computationally efficient in principle, methods resulting from the common implementation of the relevant HMM techniques remain intractable for large genomic datasets.Results: To address this issue, a set of algorithmic improvements for performing the exact HMM computation is introduced here, by exploiting the particular structure of the CSD and typical characteristics of genomic data. It is empirically demonstrated that these improvements result in a speedup of several orders of magnitude for large datasets and that the speedup continues to increase with the number of sequences. The optimized algorithms can be adopted in methods for various applications, including the ones mentioned above and make previously impracticable analyses possible.Availability: Software available upon request.Supplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Contact: yss@eecs.berkeley.edu},

  abstract = {How populations diverge and give rise to distinct species remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology, with important implications for a wide range of fields, from conservation genetics to human evolution. A promising approach is to estimate parameters of simple speciation models using polymorphism data from multiple loci. Existing methods, however, make a number of assumptions that severely limit their applicability, notably, no gene flow after the populations split and no intralocus recombination. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate parameters of an isolation-migration model. The approach uses summaries of polymorphism data at multiple loci surveyed in a pair of diverging populations or closely related species and, importantly, allows for intralocus recombination. To illustrate its potential, we applied it to extensive polymorphism data from populations and species of apes, whose demographic histories are largely unknown. The isolation-migration model appears to provide a reasonable fit to the data. It suggests that the two chimpanzee species became reproductively isolated in allopatry ~850 Kya, while Western and Central chimpanzee populations split ~440 Kya but continued to exchange migrants. Similarly, Eastern and Western gorillas and Sumatran and Bornean orangutans appear to have experienced gene flow since their splits ~90 and over 250 Kya, respectively.},

Here, we examine the joint allele frequency distributions across continental human populations and present an approach for combining complementary aspects of whole-genome, low-coverage data and targeted high-coverage data. We apply this approach to data generated by the pilot phase of the Thousand Genomes Project, including whole-genome 2–4× coverage data for 179 samples from HapMap European, Asian, and African panels as well as high-coverage target sequencing of the exons of 800 genes from 697 individuals in seven populations. We use the site frequency spectra obtained from these data to infer demographic parameters for an Out-of-Africa model for populations of African, European, and Asian descent and to predict, by a jackknife-based approach, the amount of genetic diversity that will be discovered as sample sizes are increased. We predict that the number of discovered nonsynonymous coding variants will reach 100,000 in each population after ~1,000 sequenced chromosomes per population, whereas ~2,500 chromosomes will be needed for the same number of synonymous variants. Beyond this point, the number of segregating sites in the European and Asian panel populations is expected to overcome that of the African panel because of faster recent population growth. Overall, we find that the majority of human genomic variable sites are rare and exhibit little sharing among diverged populations. Our results emphasize that replication of disease association for specific rare genetic variants across diverged populations must overcome both reduced statistical power because of rarity and higher population divergence.},

A benefit of having a full multipopulation model, relative to conducting multiple pairwise analyses between sampled populations, is that a full model can reveal historical gene flow involving ancestral populations. An example of this was found in which gene flow is indicated between the western common chimpanzee subspecies and the ancestor of the central and the eastern common chimpanzee subspecies. The results of a full analysis on all four populations are strongly consistent with analyses on pairs of populations and generally similar to results from previous studies. The basal split between bonobos and common chimpanzees was estimated at 0.93 Ma (0.68–1.54 Ma, 95% highest posterior density interval), with the split among the ancestor of three common chimpanzee populations at 0.46 Ma (0.35–0.65), and the most recent split between central and eastern common chimpanzee populations at 0.093 Ma (0.041–0.157). Population size estimates mostly fell in the range from 5,000 to 10,000 individuals. The exceptions are the size of the ancestor of the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, at 17,000 (8,000–28,000) individuals, and the central common chimpanzee and its immediate ancestor with the eastern common chimpanzee, which have effective size estimates at 27,000 (16,000–44,000) and 32,000 (19,000–54,000) individuals, respectively.},

  abstract = {A formula for the variance of gene identity (homozygosity) was derived for the case of neutral mutations using diffusion approximations for the changes of gene frequencies in a subdivided population. It is shown that when gene flow is extremely small, the variance of gene identity for the entire population at equilibrium is smaller than that of the panmictic population with the same mean gene identity. On the other hand, although a large amount of gene flow makes a subdivided population equivalent to a panmictic population, there is an intermediate range of gene flow in which population subdivision can increase the variance. This increase results from the increased variance between colonies. In such a case, each colony has a predominant allele, but the predominant type may differ from colony to colony. The formula for obtaining the variance allows us to study such statistics as the coefficient of gene differentiation and the correlation of heterozygosity. Computer simulations were conducted to study the distribution of gene identity as well as to check the validity of the analytical formulas. Effects of selection were also studied by simulations.},

A maximum likelihood (ML) method is developed to estimate a, and its power and reliability is investigated by coalescent simulations. The ML method is applied to nucleotide divergence data between human and chimpanzee. It is found that the null model with an instantaneous species split explains the data best, and no strong evidence for gene flow is detected. The result is discussed in the view of the mode of speciation. Another ML method is developed to estimate the male-female ratio (a) of mutation rate, in which the coalescent process in the ancestral population is taken into account.},

We calculate the probability that the gene tree of one locus is concordant with the species tree, given that the gene tree of the other locus is concordant. We define a threshold value of the recombination rate, r*, to be the rate for which the difference between the conditional probability of concordance and its asymptotic value is reduced to 5% of the initial difference. We find that, although r* depends in a complicated way on the times of speciation and effective population sizes, it is always relatively small, <10/N4, where N4 is the effective size of the species represented by the internal branch of the species tree. Consequently, the concordance of gene trees of neutral loci with the species tree is expected to be on roughly the same length scale on the chromosome as the extent of significant linkage disequilibrium within species unless the effective size of contemporary populations is very different from the effective sizes of their ancestral populations. Both balancing selection and selective sweeps can result in much longer genomic regions having concordant gene trees.},

  Abstract = { The determination of the distribution of aggregate losses is of crucial importance for an insurer. In this paper, we propose a technique for approximating the distribution of univariate and bivariate aggregate losses, which is solely based on their moments. Accordingly, this methodology can be implemented without any specific knowledge of the claim number or size distributions. The numerical examples presented herein indicate that the proposed approach constitutes a viable alternative to the commonly used recursive and FFT methods. },

@article{GzTa12,
  Abstract = {In the insurance and banking industries, as in many branches of engineering, in many instances a model can be proposed to describe either the accumulated losses or the accumulated damage or stress. Such models are of the compound type, namely random sums of independent positive random variables, and a reliable statistical model is available for both. But computing the distribution of such random sums is a hard problem that has received much attention. Here we propose a technique based on the maximum entropy method which makes use of the fractional moments of the exponential of the accumulated loss, which is available since for many models the Laplace transform can be exactly determined. Here we provide an answer to the question of how to determine distribution of a total severity when the only information that we have consists of the Laplace transform of the compound distribution. Our technique yields fairly good reconstructions from a low number of fractional moments. },

  Abstract = { For any function f on the non-negative integers, we can evaluate the cumulative function o f given by o f ( s )= ~ s x=0 f ( x ) from the values of f by the recursion o f ( s )= o f ( s -1)+ f ( s ). Analogously we can use this procedure t times to evaluate the t -th order cumulative function o t f . As an alternative, in the present paper we shall derive recursions for direct evaluation of o t f when f itself satisfies a certain sort of recursion. We shall also derive recursions for the t -th order tails v t f where v f ( s )= ~ X x=s+1 f ( x ). The recursions can be applied for exact and approximate evaluation of distribution functions and stop-loss transforms of probability distributions. The class of recursions for f includes the classes discussed by Sundt (1992), incorporating the class studied by Panjer's (1981). We discuss in particular convolutions and compound functions. },

  Abstract = {AbstractIn this paper, we study two classes of optimal reinsurance models by minimizing the total risk exposure of an insurer under the criteria of value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR). We assume that the reinsurance premium is calculated according to the expected value principle. Explicit solutions for the optimal reinsurance policies are derived over ceded loss functions with increasing degrees of generality. More precisely, we establish formally that under the VaR minimization model, (i) the stop-loss reinsurance is optimal among the class of increasing convex ceded loss functions; (ii) when the constraints on both ceded and retained loss functions are relaxed to increasing functions, the stop-loss reinsurance with an upper limit is shown to be optimal; (iii) and finally under the set of general increasing and left-continuous retained loss functions, the truncated stop-loss reinsurance is shown to be optimal. In contrast, under CVaR risk measure, the stop-loss reinsurance is shown to be always optimal. These results suggest that the VaR-based reinsurance models are sensitive with respect to the constraints imposed on both ceded and retained loss functions while the corresponding CVaR-based reinsurance models are quite robust.},

We provide a simpler and more transparent approach to solve these problems by using intuitive geometric arguments. The usefulness of this approach is further demonstrated by solving the VaR-minimization problem when the expectation premium principle is replaced by Wang's premium principle.},

  abstract  = {Let $$l(v) = E_{v_1 } \{ L(Y,v_2 )\} $$ be the expected performance measure of a discrete event system ( DES ), where L is the sample performance depending on the vector of parameters v 2 and driven by an input vector Y , which has a probability density function (pdf) f ( y, v 1 ), v =( v 1 , v 2 ) is a vector of parameters, and the subscript v 1 in E $$E_{v_1 } L$$ indicates that the expectation is taken with respect to the pdf f ( y, v 1 ). Suppose that l ( v ) is not available analytically and we want to evaluate (estimate) it, as well as the associated sensitivities âˆ‡ k l ( v ), k =1, 2, ... simultaneously for different values of v =( v 1 , v 2 ) via simulation. In this paper, we show that in some cases interesting for applications, we can estimate l ( v ) and âˆ‡ k l ( v ), k =1,2, ... by using the so-called â€œ push out â€ technique. More precisely, we show that it is possible to replace the original sample performance by an auxiliary one while â€œpushing outâ€ the parameter vector v 2 from the original sample performance function L ( Y , v 2 ) to a pdf $$\tilde f$$ ( x , v 1 , v 2 ) associated with the original one f ( y , v 1 ). We also show how both the auxiliary sample performance and the associated pdf can be obtained from their original counterparts and how to combine them together to perform sensitivity analysis for the original DES. Particular emphasis will be placed on the case where the sample performance function L ( y , v 2 ) is neither analytically available nor everywhere differentiable in v 2 . We finally discuss the advantage of the proposed method and present numerical results supporting our theory.},

  abstract  = {all The problem of calculating posterior probabilities for a collection of competing models and associated Bayes factors continues to be a formidable challenge for applied Bayesian statisticians. Current approaches that take advantage of modern Markov chain Monte Carlo computing methods include those that attempt to sample over some form of the joint space created by the model indicators and the parameters for each model, others that sample over the model space alone, and still others that attempt to estimate the marginal likelihood of each model directly (because the collection of these is equivalent to the collection of model probabilities themselves). We review several methods and compare them in the context of three examples: a simple regression example, a more challenging hierarchical longitudinal model, and a binary data latent variable model. We find that the joint model-parameter space search methods perform adequately but can be difficult to program and tune, whereas the marginal likelihood methods often are less troublesome and require less additional coding. Our results suggest that the latter methods may be most appropriate for practitioners working in many standard model choice settings, but the former remain important for comparing models of varying dimension (e.g., multiple changepoint models) or models whose parameters cannot easily be updated in relatively few blocks. We caution, however, that all methods we compared require significant human and computer effort, and this suggests that less formal Bayesian model choice methods may offer a more realistic alternative in many cases.},

  abstract   = {This paper reviews the Fourier-series method for calculating cumulative distribution functions (cdf's) and probability mass functions (pmf's) by numerically inverting characteristic functions, Laplace transforms and generating functions. Some variants of the Fourier-series method are remarkably easy to use, requiring programs of less than fifty lines. The Fourier-series method can be interpreted as numerically integrating a standard inversion integral by means of the trapezoidal rule. The same formula is obtained by using the Fourier series of an associated periodic function constructed by aliasing; this explains the name of the method. This Fourier analysis applies to the inversion problem because the Fourier coefficients are just values of the transform. The mathematical centerpiece of the Fourier-series method is the Poisson summation formula, which identifies the discretization error associated with the trapezoidal rule and thus helps bound it. The greatest difficulty is approximately calculating the infinite series obtained from the inversion integral. Within this framework, lattice cdf's can be calculated from generating functions by finite sums without truncation. For other cdf's, an appropriate truncation of the infinite series can be determined from the transform based on estimates or bounds. For Laplace transforms, the numerical integration can be made to produce a nearly alternating series, so that the convergence can be accelerated by techniques such as Euler summation. Alternatively, the cdf can be perturbed slightly by convolution smoothing or windowing to produce a truncation error bound independent of the original cdf. Although error bounds can be determined, an effective approach is to use two different methods without elaborate error analysis. For this purpose, we also describe two methods for inverting Laplace transforms based on the Post-Widder inversion formula. The overall procedure is illustrated by several queueing examples.},

  abstract = {We present an Aboriginal Australian genomic sequence obtained from a 100-year-old lock of hair donated by an Aboriginal man from southern Western Australia in the early 20th century. We detect no evidence of European admixture and estimate contamination levels to be below 0.5%. We show that Aboriginal Australians are descendants of an early human dispersal into eastern Asia, possibly 62,000 to 75,000 years ago. This dispersal is separate from the one that gave rise to modern Asians 25,000 to 38,000 years ago. We also find evidence of gene flow between populations of the two dispersal waves prior to the divergence of Native Americans from modern Asian ancestors. Our findings support the hypothesis that present-day Aboriginal Australians descend from the earliest humans to occupy Australia, likely representing one of the oldest continuous populations outside Africa.},
